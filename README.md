# Frontend Repository for Geographic API Server 
A frontend web application for interacting with a geographic data platform that manages countries, states, and cities. This application provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and performing CRUD operations on geographic data through a RESTful backend API.

The project is designed with a production-style mindset, emphasizing clear UI structure, seamless frontend–backend integration, and maintainable code practices. It serves both as a learning exercise in full-stack development and as a portfolio-quality frontend demonstrating effective API consumption, state management, and user interaction design.

## Steps to run the frontend:
1. Use command `python3 -m http.server 9000` to run the frontend
2. Go to `http://localhost:9000` to view the frontend

## To Combine it with the backend:
1. First go to `rjrtm` and run command `./local.sh`. This will start the backend. Note that the backend local host will appear on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
2. Go to `rjrtm-frontend` and run command `python3 -m http.server 9000`. This will start the frontend. Note that the frontend local host will appear on `http://localhost:9000`
